# Goal

Develop simple application that allows to control the budget for users.

Application must contain these functions:

- simple user login
- define categories (food, travel,…)
- possibility to record expenses and incomes (date, info, value)
- easily distinguish expenses/incomes by colour
- charts for visualising data

Should be done in ReactJS, no BE necessary - save data only locally (localStorage…). You can use UI libraries by your own preferences (preferably MaterialUI).

# Notes

- Didn't install vitest peer deps, because I'm going to avoid palywright and other deps for now.

# TODO

- favicon (html, public)
- install recoil, work on state
