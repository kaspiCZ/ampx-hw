# AmpX assignment - Budget Control app

A simple budgeting app to track incomes and expenses

# Installation

## Dependencies

Using [Volta](https://volta.sh/) is strongly recommended as it simplifies Node.js version handling. Then `npm i` should provide everything necessary.

## Prerequisites

Needs you to set up Firebase with Cloud Firestore. Copy `.env.sample` and rename to `.env.local` and fill in your Cloud Firestore configuration.

These are the recommended Firestore rules for multi-user environment:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
  	match /transactions/{transaction} {
    	allow write: if request.auth != null // && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.uid
      allow read, update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.uid
    }

    match /tags/{tag} {
    	allow write: if request.auth != null // && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.uid
      allow read, update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.uid
    }

    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

Note: The commented out rules are not yet tested and should tighten security.

You will need these composite indexes added:

```
transactions 	uid Ascending date Descending __name__ Descending	Collection
transactions 	uid Ascending date Ascending __name__ Ascending	Collection
```

## Usage

The app uses [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev). You can find more details in their respective documentation.

You can either run the app in development `npm run dev`

or build and preview `npm run build` ðŸ‘‰ `npm run preview`
